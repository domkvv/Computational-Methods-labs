## Computational Methods - labs

This repo contains exercises with my solutions for the Computational Methods in Science and Technology course at CS AGH UST 21/22. Most of the notebooks are written in Julia, some of them in R. There are also few additional C code pieces converted to Markdown. 

1. [Introduction to Julia and floating point numbers representation](https://github.com/domkvv/Computational-Methods-labs/tree/main/lab1) - basic exercises with floating point numbers representation characteristics
2. [Introduction to Julia Data Frames and Plots](https://github.com/domkvv/Computational-Methods-labs/tree/main/lab2) - comparison of scalar and matrix multiplication runtime in Julia
3. [Interpolation in Julia](https://github.com/domkvv/Computational-Methods-labs/tree/main/lab3) - comparison of Lagrange's, Newton's and Polynomials package's interpolation methods, Neville's algorithm example
4. [Approximation in R](https://github.com/domkvv/Computational-Methods-labs/tree/main/lab4) - working with the data from point 2.
5. [Approximation in Julia](https://github.com/domkvv/Computational-Methods-labs/tree/main/lab5) - comparison of different matrix multiplication methods runtime in Julia and C,  comparison of   interpolation   with Chebyshev and equally spaced nodes, example of Pade approximation
6. [Hermite Interpolation in Julia](https://github.com/domkvv/Computational-Methods-labs/tree/main/lab6) - Hermite Interpolation of given data set (ECG)
